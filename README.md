## What Is Cloud?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like storage, servers, databases, software, and more—over the internet. Instead of saving files or running programs on your local computer, the cloud allows you to access these resources online, from anywhere, at any time.

It helps individuals and businesses save cost, scale easily, and improve accessibility. Common examples include services like Google Drive, iCloud, and Microsoft Azure.
